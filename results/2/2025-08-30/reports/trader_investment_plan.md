Okay, I've reviewed the proposed investment plan and the rationale for selling Peloton (PTON). I agree with the assessment that the cost-cutting measures are unsustainable and the at-home fitness market is saturated. The analysis correctly identifies the risks outweighing the potential rewards and emphasizes the importance of avoiding "bottom fishing."

Given the current market conditions and the specific analysis provided, I will follow the recommendation.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**
