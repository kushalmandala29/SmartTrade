Based on the available data and the current date (2025-09-13), I am unable to provide a complete analysis because the indicator data is not available for the current date, as it is a weekend/holiday. However, I can still provide a general framework for analysis and suggest the most relevant indicators based on the provided descriptions.

Here's an analysis framework and indicator selection:

**1. Trend Analysis and Confirmation:**

*   **close\_50\_sma:** This medium-term moving average helps identify the underlying trend.
*   **close\_200\_sma:** The long-term moving average confirms the overall trend. The relationship between the 50 SMA and 200 SMA (golden cross or death cross) can provide significant signals.
*   **close\_10\_ema:** This short-term moving average will help to identify short term momentum and potential entry points.

**2. Momentum and Trend Strength:**

*   **macd:** The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is crucial for identifying momentum shifts and potential trend reversals. Crossovers of the MACD line with its signal line can provide buy/sell signals.
*   **macds:** The MACD Signal line helps to smooth the MACD line and can provide additional confirmation for buy/sell signals.

**3. Volatility and Risk Management:**

*   **atr:** The Average True Range (ATR) is essential for assessing current market volatility. This is used to set stop-loss levels and manage position sizes appropriately.

**4. Indicator Selection Rationale:**

*   The chosen indicators provide a good balance of trend identification, momentum analysis, and volatility assessment.
*   The moving averages help to gauge the direction and strength of the trend.
*   MACD and MACD Signal provide momentum signals to confirm trend changes.
*   ATR aids in risk management by quantifying volatility.

**5. Detailed Analysis (Hypothetical, based on how I would use the data if it were available):**

*   **Trend:** I would analyze the positions of the 50 SMA and 200 SMA. A sustained period where the 50 SMA is above the 200 SMA would indicate an uptrend, while the opposite would indicate a downtrend. The 10 EMA would be used to identify short-term momentum and potential entry points.
*   **Momentum:** I would examine the MACD and Signal lines. If the MACD line crosses above the signal line, it could be a buy signal, and if it crosses below, it could be a sell signal. I would also look for divergence, where the price makes a new high, but the MACD does not (or vice-versa), which could signal a potential reversal.
*   **Volatility:** I would use the ATR to determine the average daily price range. This information is critical for setting stop-loss orders and managing risk. A higher ATR value would indicate higher volatility, requiring wider stop-loss levels.
*   **Combining Indicators:** I would use the indicators in conjunction. For example, if the 50 SMA is above the 200 SMA (uptrend), and the MACD crosses above its signal line (buy signal), this would provide a strong bullish signal.

**6. Trading Strategy (Hypothetical):**

*   **Entry:** Buy when the 10 EMA crosses above the 50 SMA, and the MACD crosses above its signal line, provided the 50 SMA is above the 200 SMA.
*   **Stop-Loss:** Set a stop-loss order based on the ATR. For example, place the stop-loss at a distance of 2x ATR below the entry price.
*   **Target:** The target price could be determined using a risk-reward ratio. For instance, aim for a profit that is 2x the potential loss.
