Based on the comprehensive analysis and taking into account the critical factors and potential risks, I am recommending to sell the existing Tesla (TSLA) holdings. The declining market share, increasing competition, leadership risks, and negative news outweigh the potential of the EV market and Tesla's technological advantages at this time.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**
